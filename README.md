# Salary Calculator


## Description

Describe in my own words...

I took this assignment as an exercise on how to incorporate everything we've learned so far in one challege. We needed to create a webpage skeleton with the base of a table in which we would use javascript and jQuery in tandem to append data into. We we able to create input fields and an operational button to add our inputs into our base table, with values that represent an employees name, ID, title and annual salary. We took it a step further by calculating monthly costs of each individual employee we added to our table and displaying that cost at the bottom of the table. For each new employee we add, that total will represent a new sum of total monthly costs. To top it off, we included a delete button which presents on each employee row which will eliminate that employees information from the table. The last thing I did was add some coloration and positioned aspects of the webpage the best I could.

The stretch goals challenge us to go a step further with our deletion. If we remove an employee, the total cost should also go down as now their monthly cost is no longer relevent. On the backend... we are challenged to store data in arrays and objects and create an alert that will inform the user if input fields are missing when submitting employee info.
